# Duality

My first homebrew GameBoy game.
A port of the GTA San Andreas Arcade Game Duality.

## Getting Started

You need the [GBDK-2020](https://gbdk.org/docs/api/docs_getting_started.html) to build the ROM and [Gearboy](https://github.com/drhelius/Gearboy) to emulate it comfortably.
Then just build a debug version and run it in the emulator, with debug symbols already loaded.

    make run

For the release build, simply add `GBDK_RELEASE=1` to your make invocation after running `make clean`.
